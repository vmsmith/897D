* The report should be no more than 10 single-spaced pages long.
* It should include all substantive details of your analyses (the key word here is “substantive”).
* The report should have sections (e.g., Introduction, Analysis, Results, Conclusion) and provide sufficient details that anyone with a reasonable statistics background could understand exactly what you’ve done.
* Feel free to briefly mention any exploratory aspects from your analyses, but do not devote a lot of space to discussions of dead-ends, pursuit of unproductive ideas, coding problems, etc.
* Consider using tables and figures to enhance your report.
* Do not embed R code in the body of your report; instead attach the code in an appendix. The appendix does not count towards the page limit.
