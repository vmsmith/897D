#### Sat, 30 Apr
* To Do
  * Rick: Architect the classification section to incororate feature selection
  * Rick: SVM tuning
  * Rick: Profit comparisons with full and reduced models
  * Rick: ROC plots
  * Rick: Template for regression method descriptions
  * Cheryl: Write feature selection 
  * Keith: Data for comparison table. For each regression method
    *  Predicted profit
    *  Mean predicted error
    *  Standard error
    *  Number of features

* Topics
  * Lower profit with KNN using reduced variable set
  * 1 and 0 to "D" and "N" at the beginning of classification?
  * SVM tuning
  * Cross-validation
  * ROC plots

* Next meeting:

#### Sun, 24 Apr 
* 4:40 pm - Next Zoom at 8:00 pm EST

* 4:30 pm - Rick posted histograms in EDA folder as `histograms.R`.

* 4:00 pm - Zoom conference with Cheryl, Keith, and Rick
  * Rick will work on exploratory data analysis and various transforms.
  * Rick will document code over the next two days.
  * Rick will send e-mail update when new things are posted to GitHub.
  * Rick will post histogram code on GitHub today.
  * Cheryl will look at variable reduction methods, e.g., Best Subset, LASSO, LDA.
  * Keith will look at advanced regression methods on the linear regression part and compare output to OLS output.
